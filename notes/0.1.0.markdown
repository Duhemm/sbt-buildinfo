This is the initial release sbt-buildinfo.

Usage
-----

Add the following in your `build.sbt`:


    seq(buildInfoSettings: _*)
    
    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= buildInfo
    
    buildInfoKeys := Seq[Scoped](name, version, scalaVersion, sbtVersion)

When you reload the settings and compile, this generates the following:

    package buildinfo
    
    object BuildInfo {
      val name = "helloworld"
      val version = "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
      val scalaVersion = "2.9.1"
      val sbtVersion = "0.11.2"
    }

Any setting can be added to `buildInfoKeys`. See [readme][1] for more info.
