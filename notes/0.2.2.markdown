## Actions

In addition to the usual settings, tasks, and custom fields, sbt-buildinfo 0.2.2 intoduces support for actions.

    buildInfoKeys ++= Seq[BuildInfoKey](
      name, version, scalaVersion,
      "custom" -> 1234
      BuildInfoKey.action("buildTime") {
        System.currentTimeMillis
      }
    )

The code block in the action would be re-computed each time at compile.

    package buildinfo

    case object BuildInfo {
      val name = "helloworld"
      val version = "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
      val scalaVersion = "2.10.0"
      val custom = 1234
      val buildTime = 1346906092160L
    }

This feature was originally contributed by [@Rogach](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-buildinfo/pull/7) and was later tweaked by [@eed3si9n](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-buildinfo/commit/b1691ff39249848aa65eaddd28c712da4c35c334).

## Minor enhancement

`BuildInfo` object is now a case object. [#9][9]
