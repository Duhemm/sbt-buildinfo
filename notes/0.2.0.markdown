## breaking change `BuildInfoKey`

Starting 0.2.0 `buildInfoKeys` are changed from `Seq[Scoped]` to `Seq[BuildInfoKey]. This requires you to change build.sbt as:

    buildInfoSettings

    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= buildInfo

    buildInfoKeys := Seq[BuildInfoKey](name, version, scalaVersion, sbtVersion)

    buildInfoPackage := "hello"

In addition to normal keys, you can now map exiting value using `BuildInfoKey.map` or add new fields using tuples:


    buildInfoKeys ++= Seq[BuildInfoKey](
      "custom" -> 1234,
      BuildInfo.map(name) { case (k, v) => "project" + k.capitalize -> v.capitalize }
    )

This generates:

    val custom = 1234
    val projectName = "Helloworld"

This feature was contributed by [Sciss][Sciss] ([#4][4] and [#5][5]).

## minor enhancements and bug fixes

- `java.net.URL` values are supported, instead of falling back to `String`
- `Option[A]` values are typed as options, instead of `Some[A]`
