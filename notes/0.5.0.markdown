### allow one build info object per configuration

sbt-buildinfo 0.5.0 supports multiple configurations.

    buildInfoScopedSettings(Test)

[#61][61] by [@asflierl][@asflierl]

### BuildInfoOption.Traits

There's a new option called `BuildInfoOption.Traits` to mixin traits to the generated object.

    buildInfoOptions += BuildInfoOption.Traits("TestTrait1", "TestTrait2")

[#58][58] by [@liff][@liff]

### BuildInfoOption.BuildTime

There's another option called `BuildInfoOption.BuildTime`.

    buildInfoOptions += BuildInfoOption.BuildTime

This will generate timestamp values as follows:

    /** The value is "2015-07-30 03:30:16.849". */
    val builtAtString: String = "2015-07-30 03:30:16.849"
    /** The value is 1438227016849L. */
    val builtAtMillis: Long = 1438227016849L

### different renderers

[@pdalpra][@pdalpra] refactored the code base so the build info
can be generated as something other than a Scala source file.

[#67][67] by [@pdalpra][@pdalpra]

### explicit imports

The code generated by sbt-buildinfo 0.5.0 will explicitly import names, so it is `-Yno-imports` safe.
