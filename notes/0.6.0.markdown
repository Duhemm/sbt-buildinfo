### buildInfoUsePackageAsPath

sbt-buildinfo 0.6.0 adds a new settting called `buildInfoUsePackageAsPath`.
When set to `true`, the generated file will be placed in the directory structure matching the package name, for instance `target/scala-2.10/src_managed/main/x/y/z/BuildInfo.scala` for the package `x.y.z`. This is aimed to work around the IDEs that demand the file position to match the package namespace.

This feature was contributed as [#75][75] by [@peter-fu][@peter-fu].

### minor fixes

- Explicitly specifies UTF-8 to write the file. [#77][77] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Adds trailing end line to the generated. [#70][70] by [@mallman][@mallman]
