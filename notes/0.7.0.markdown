### fixes

- If generating resources, put them into resourceManaged. #94 by @alexeyr

### buildInfoRenderFactory

One can now use

    buildInfoRenderFactory := ScalaCaseClassRenderer.apply

To switch to another Renderer. Also added a Case Class renderer, which will create a case class AND an object that inherits the class. This makes it easy to use a jsonFormatter with the output. #98 by @axos88

### buildInfoValues

Adds `buildInfoValues` task, which exposes the set of `BuildInfoResult` objects used by sbt-buildinfo to generate BuildInfo files.
This can be used within the sbt build itself to add the build info to the jar Manifest. #89 by @jastice
