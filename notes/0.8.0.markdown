sbt-buildinfo 0.8.0 is published for sbt 1.

### BuildInfoKey.of(...) and BuildInfoKey.ofN(...)

Prior to 0.8.0 when sbt-buildinfo generated the `BuildInfo` object using tasks, it was executing the tasks out-of-graph.
This would occasionally cause race conditions when used with side-effecty tasks.

To workaround this issue sbt-buildinfo introduces a new `BuildInfokey.of(...)` and `BuildInfoKey.ofN(...)` macro that will safely execute the tasks within the control of the task engine.

#### Before 0.8.0

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .enablePlugins(BuildInfoPlugin)
  .settings(
    buildInfoKeys := Seq[BuildInfoKey](name, version, someTask),
    buildInfoPackage := "hello"
  )
```

#### After 0.8.0

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .enablePlugins(BuildInfoPlugin)
  .settings(
    buildInfoKeys := BuildInfoKey.ofN(name, version, someTask),
    buildInfoPackage := "hello"
  )
```
